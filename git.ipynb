    "**Git and GitHub Tutorial for Beginners**\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will guide you through the basics of version control using Git and GitHub.  We'll use a simple Python calculator program as our example project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You'll Learn:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   What Git and GitHub are and why they're important.\n",
    "*   Installing Git.\n",
    "*   Basic Git workflow: initializing a repository, staging changes, committing changes, pushing to GitHub, branching, merging, and pulling updates.\n",
    "*   How to use GitHub to collaborate on projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Introduction: What are Git and GitHub?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Git:** A distributed version control system. It tracks changes to your code over time, allowing you to revert to previous versions, compare changes, and collaborate with others easily.  Git works *locally* on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **GitHub:** A web-based hosting service for Git repositories.  It provides a central place to store your code, collaborate with others, track issues, and manage projects. GitHub is *remote* (in the cloud).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use Git and GitHub?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Version Control:**  Never lose your work again! Easily go back to previous states of your project.\n",
    "*   **Collaboration:**  Work with others on the same codebase without overwriting each other's changes.\n",
    "*   **Backup:**  Your code is safely stored on GitHub's servers.\n",
    "*   **Open Source:**  Contribute to and learn from a vast community of developers.\n",
    "*   **Project Management:** Track bugs, feature requests, and progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Installation**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Git:** Download and install Git from the official website: [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).  Follow the installation instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).\n",
    "    *   **Verify Installation:** Open your terminal (or command prompt on Windows) and type `git --version`.  You should see the installed Git version.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **GitHub Account:** Create a free account on GitHub: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Setting Up Your First Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Create a Project Directory:** Create a new folder on your computer for your project (e.g., `my_calculator`).\n",
    "2.  **Create the Python File:**  Create a new file named `simple_calculator.py` inside the `my_calculator` directory and paste the Python code provided above into it.\n",
    "3.  **Initialize a Git Repository:**\n",
    "    *   Open your terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to your project directory using the `cd` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        cd path/to/your/my_calculator  # Replace with the actual path\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   Initialize a Git repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        git init\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        This command creates a hidden `.git` folder in your project directory, which is where Git stores all the version control information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Basic Git Workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Check the Status:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git status\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    This command shows you the current state of your repository.  You'll see that `simple_calculator.py` is \"untracked,\" meaning Git is not yet tracking changes to this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Stage Changes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git add simple_calculator.py  # Add a specific file\n",
    "    git add .                    # Add all changed files in the directory\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    The `git add` command stages changes. Staging means preparing the changes you've made to be included in the next *commit*. Think of it like adding items to a shopping cart before checking out.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Commit Changes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git commit -m \"Initial commit: Created basic calculator functions\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    The `git commit` command creates a snapshot of your staged changes.  The `-m` flag allows you to add a descriptive commit message.  **Always write clear and concise commit messages!** This message is crucial for understanding the history of your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Connecting to GitHub (Creating a Remote Repository)**\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   **Create a New Repository on GitHub:**\n",
    "        1.  Go to your GitHub account and click the \"+\" button in the top right corner, then select \"New repository.\"\n",
    "        2.  Give your repository a name (e.g., `my-calculator`).  You can add a description if you like.\n",
    "        3.  Choose whether to make it public or private.\n",
    "        4.  **Do not** initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license at this stage (we'll add these later if needed).\n",
    "        5.  Click \"Create repository.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   **Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub:**\n",
    "        *   GitHub will now show you instructions on how to connect your local repository.  You'll see a section titled \"...or push an existing repository from the command line.\"  Copy the commands provided there.  They will look something like this (but with your username and repository name):\n",
    "\n",
    "            ```bash\n",
    "            git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/your-repository-name.git\n",
    "            git branch -M main\n",
    "            git push -u origin main\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "        *  `git remote add origin <URL>`: This command adds a \"remote\" named \"origin\" that points to your GitHub repository.  A remote is essentially a nickname for a URL.\n",
    "        *  `git branch -M main`: This renames the default branch from `master` to `main` (a common practice now).\n",
    "        * `git push -u origin main`: This *pushes* (uploads) your local commits to the `main` branch on the `origin` remote (your GitHub repository).  The `-u` flag sets the upstream branch, so you can simply use `git push` and `git pull` in the future without specifying the branch and remote.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Making More Changes and Committing**\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   Open `simple_calculator.py` and make some changes. For example, add docstrings to your functions (as in the improved code above).  Or add a new function, like a `square` function.\n",
    "    *   Save the file.\n",
    "    *   Run `git status` to see the changes.\n",
    "    *   Stage the changes: `git add simple_calculator.py`\n",
    "    *   Commit the changes: `git commit -m \"Added docstrings and square function\"`\n",
    "    *   Push the changes to GitHub: `git push`\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Branching and Merging**\n",
    "\n",
    "Branching is a powerful feature of Git that allows you to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Create a New Branch:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git checkout -b feature/add-power-function\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    This command creates a new branch named `feature/add-power-function` and switches to it.  The `checkout` command is used to switch between branches.  The `-b` flag tells Git to create the branch if it doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Make Changes on the Branch:**\n",
    "    *   Add a `power` function to `simple_calculator.py`.\n",
    "    *   Stage and commit your changes as before: `git add`, `git commit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Push the Branch to GitHub:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git push -u origin feature/add-power-function\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Create a Pull Request (on GitHub):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   Go to your repository on GitHub. You'll see a notification about your recently pushed branch.\n",
    "    *   Click the \"Compare & pull request\" button.\n",
    "    *   Write a description of your changes.\n",
    "    *   Click \"Create pull request.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    A pull request (PR) is a request to merge your changes from one branch (the feature branch) into another (usually the `main` branch).  It allows others to review your code, suggest changes, and discuss the changes before merging.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Merge the Pull Request (on GitHub):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   If everything looks good, click the \"Merge pull request\" button.\n",
    "    *   Confirm the merge.\n",
    "    *   You can delete the `feature/add-power-function` branch after merging (GitHub usually offers a button to do this).\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Update Your Local `main` Branch:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   Back in your terminal, switch to the `main` branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        git checkout main\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   Pull the latest changes from GitHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        git pull\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        This command *fetches* the latest changes from the `origin` remote and *merges* them into your current branch (`main`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Other Useful Git Commands**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `git log`: View the commit history.  You can use options like `--oneline`, `--graph`, `--author`, and `--since` to customize the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git log --oneline --graph\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `git diff`: Show the differences between your working directory and the last commit, or between two commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git diff                 # Changes since last commit\n",
    "    git diff HEAD~2 HEAD     # Differences between the last commit and two commits ago\n",
    "    git diff branch1 branch2 # Differences between two branches\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "* `git clone <repository_url>`: Create a local copy of a remote repository.  This is how you'd download a project from GitHub to your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `git stash`: Temporarily save changes that you don't want to commit yet.  Useful if you need to switch branches quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git stash   # Stash changes\n",
    "    git stash pop # Apply stashed changes and remove from stash\n",
    "    git stash list #list stashes\n",
    "    git stash drop #remove latest stash\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "* `git checkout <commit_hash>`: Checkout a specific commit by its hash. Use `git log` to get commit hashes. *This puts you in a \"detached HEAD\" state*.\n",
    "* `git checkout <file>`: Discard the changes in the file. The file will revert to it's status in the last commit.\n",
    "*   `.gitignore`: Create a file named `.gitignore` in your project's root directory to tell Git which files or folders to ignore (e.g., temporary files, build artifacts, sensitive information).  This is *very* important!  You can find example `.gitignore` files for Python projects online.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Resolving Merge Conflicts**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, when you try to merge branches, Git will encounter a *merge conflict*. This happens when two branches have made changes to the same lines of the same file. Git can't automatically decide which changes to keep.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Identify the Conflict:** Git will tell you which files have conflicts.  Open the file(s) in a text editor.\n",
    "2.  **Edit the File:** Git will have added markers to the file to show the conflicting sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    <<<<<<< HEAD\n",
    "    # Code from your current branch\n",
    "    =======\n",
    "    # Code from the branch you're merging in\n",
    "    >>>>>>> feature/branch-name\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    You need to manually edit the file to resolve the conflict.  Choose which changes to keep, or combine them, and then remove the `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` markers.\n",
    "3.  **Stage and Commit:** After resolving the conflicts, stage the file (`git add`) and commit the changes (`git commit`).  Git will automatically create a merge commit message.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Best Practices**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Commit Frequently:** Make small, logical commits with clear messages.\n",
    "*   **Use Branches:** Work on new features and bug fixes in separate branches.\n",
    "*   **Write Good Commit Messages:** Explain *why* you made the changes, not just *what* you changed.\n",
    "*   **Use a .gitignore File:** Keep your repository clean by ignoring unnecessary files.\n",
    "*   **Review Pull Requests Carefully:**  Provide constructive feedback on other people's code.\n",
    "*   **Keep Your Local Repository Updated:** Use `git pull` regularly to get the latest changes from GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial covers the most important Git and GitHub concepts for beginners. There's much more to learn, but this is a solid foundation for starting your version control journey! Remember to practice, explore the documentation, and don't be afraid to experiment.\n"
